# Mid_term_project_suicides



##Problem Statement
The dataset was probed to answer following tasks/questions
1. Understanding and analysing the global trend in suicides per 100k of population and analysing trends and patterns found
2. Build a regression model to find whether there is a corelation between gdp per capita  and suicide rate globally
3. Comparative analysis of data from Canada and Australia to find out if there is much of difference between two countries across different ages and genders.
   Built regression model for data of Canada and Australia only


#### EDA
In addition to all cleaning steps, filtering was done for two countries Canada and Australia
	
#### Modeling
Regression models were built
The first one was built between GDP per capita and suicide per /100k for both the countries and it was found out to be statistically significant with R square values of 0.016 and 0.010 and repective P values are 0.017 and 0.062. Although the corelation was weak
But when we added age and gender factors also and proceeded with multivariate regression analysis, the model was not significant with p values 0
The results need to further explored
.

#### Challenges

** understanding pushing and pulling files in GITHUB took a lot of time and trials
*  
    
#### Files description


#### Future Work
Explore further on relationship between variables and dig deeper into their effect on suicide ratio per country
Checking for multicollinearities in data
Adding/joining another dataset which can give more number of features and improve modelling
Building a predictive model for this project
