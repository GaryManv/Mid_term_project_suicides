#### Collaborative Work on GitHub
In our project, we're using GitHub to work together with classmates. To make things easier, we decided to keep two separate files for each stage of the project. Everyone works on their own version, and we update them based on what we learn from each other. When a project stage is finished, we'll keep the main file in the main folder and move the working files to an archive folder.
